the saloss softestdata and softtraindata python file is used to implement dense box to detect car on the kitti datsets and can be added into
the caffe to train model. the softestdata and soft traindata have similar function.

the headportotxt is the train net prototxt file and solver.protoxt is also used in the Yinshi dataset.

the kitticar prototxt file used to train the kitticar detection use the similar saloss to calculate the loss.
