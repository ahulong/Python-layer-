'this file guide you to use the python file to train the densebox on Yinshi about detection people's head'

1.you should change the solver file parmas "net:" and "snapshot_prefix:" to your own filepath. you also cam change the other params as you wish.

2. you should change the image path parmas "param_str:" in 8layer_morenight.prototxt file in your filesystem. if you want change computing loss method, you can rewrite the multiloss python file.

3. the multiloss and multitriandata python must be put in the "../caffe/python/", change the params "caffe_root='/mnt/data1/hxw/caffe'" to your caffe root path  and if you first use the python layer, please remake caffe using the instruction WITH_PYTHON_LAYER=1 make && make pycaffe. there is a reference http://chrischoy.github.io/blog/research/caffe-python-layer/#fnref:1. 

4. the multitriandata python file is used to read data(image and bounding box label) and you can rewrite the file to read other form data as you wish.

5. the multiloss python layer is used to calculate the all loss with softmax method. you can rewite it to toher form loss fuction.
